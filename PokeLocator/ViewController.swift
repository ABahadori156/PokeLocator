    // When the app first loads for the first time, showSightingsOnMap is going to be called and cycled through for every single pokemon on the map in it's specific geographical location and it's going to add it as an annotation - then the view for annotation will be called, we created an annoIdentifier 'Pokemon' if it's a user, use the Ash location, otherwise try a dequeue a resueable cell with the info in it - IF NOT createa a default one and in any of the cases let's customize the annotation by giving the image itself on the annotation giving it a Pokemon and then we set the CanShow call out on the map then we create a button - set the frame of it and give it the image of the map and the rightCalloutAccessoryView then we return it an dit'll show up on the map

// Challenge - Change spot Random Pokemon to have it show a collection view of all the pokemon, then tap which on you want to chose to
// When you tap the pokeball, it loads up a viewController with the collectionView of the pokemon and when you tap it, you have some sort of call back that creates a sighting
//Instead of putting in (random) for pokemon, you put the ID of the pokemon you chose
